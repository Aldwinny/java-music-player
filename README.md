## Technologies

Built with Java and powered by Gradle. It uses Swing and AWT to power its GUI.

## Scope

The goal of this small project is to create a simple working music player with a GUI. I made it to practice Java programming and to apply what I know. It has:

- A working GUI
- An option to change the theme of the application
- A way to select the folder where the music is to be taken from
- Ability to play WAV files
